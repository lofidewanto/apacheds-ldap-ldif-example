Example of Simple ApacheDS LDIF Files

- Begin by installing Apache Directory Studioâ€”an integrated development environment (IDE) that comes bundled with ApacheDS, simplifying the setup process.
- Proceed to create an ApacheDS server using Apache Directory Studio and initiate its operation.
- Facilitate the population of the server by importing user data from the "test-import.ldif" file. This step ensures the presence of predefined users within the directory.
